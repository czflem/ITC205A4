Start bug1:
	Created first UAT and tested
	Started first breakpoint testing on line 69 of CheckoutCTL
		No result. Cost still = 0.0
	Added breakpoint to line 19 of ServiceCharge
		ServiceCharge.getCost returns 0.0 
			- Indicating there is no value saved
			- Bug looking more like a setting error than a getting error
	Added breakpoint to line 11 of ServiceCharge
		Checked setting the cost in ServiceCharge.ServiceCharge 
		- Cost still = 0.0
	Went to add breakpoint to Booking.addServiceCharge and noticed bug - double variable "cost" was mispelled to "cosst"
		- Corrected spelling error retested and successful results
		- Bug fixed
	
Start bug2:
	Created second UAT and tested
	Started first breakpoint at line 39 of RecordServiceCTL
	Bug appears to be that the room id is still active in the "activeBookingsByRoomId" hashmap in Hotel
		- Discovered due to the booking is simply searching the hashmap for valid roomId ints that match user input
		- 
	Followed the checkout process and no removal of a roomID from hashmap was put in. 
		- Added hashmap remove to line 129 of Hotel
		- Tested with UAT test scenario and with additional book in with random dates
		- "No active booking for room id: 101" is returned when attempting to add a service for checked out room
		- Bug fixed
