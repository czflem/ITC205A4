Created first UAT and tested
Started first breakpoint testing on line 67 of CheckoutCTL
	No result. Cost still = 0.0
Added breakpoint to line 19 of ServiceCharge
	ServiceCharge.getCost returns 0.0 
		- Indicating there is no value saved
		- Bug looking more like a setting error than a getting error
Added breakpoint to line 11 of ServiceCharge
	Checked setting the cost in ServiceCharge.ServiceCharge 
	- Cost still = 0.0
Went to add breakpoint to Booking.addServiceCharge and noticed bug - double variable "cost" was mispelled to "cosst"
	- Corrected spelling error retested and successful results
	- Bug fixed
